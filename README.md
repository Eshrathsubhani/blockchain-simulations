# Blockchain Simulations (Python)

This repo contains all my BlockChain internship Task  :
## Task 1:

Theoritical Part :
File: `Task1.pdf`

Block Simulation
- Created 3 linked blocks using SHA-256.
- Tampering Block 1 breaks the chain's integrity.
  File: `blockchainsimulation.py`

Nonce Mining Simulation
- Simulates Proof-of-Work mining.
- Calculates time and attempts needed to solve a block.
 File: `nonceminingsimulation.py`

 Consensus Mechanism Simulation
- Simulates PoW (Power), PoS (Stake), and DPoS (Votes).
- Demonstrates how different validators are chosen.
  File: `consensus mechanism simulation.py`

## Task 2:
This project is part of my internship in the field of Blockchain Technology. It presents a comparative study and analysis of three major types of blockchain platforms: Public (Ethereum),Private (Hyperledger Fabric), and Consortium (R3 Corda).
